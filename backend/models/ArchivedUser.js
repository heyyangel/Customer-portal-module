/**
 * Parking space for suspended accounts.
 *
 * Suspending a user removes the document from `users` entirely — the account
 * stops existing as far as login, customer lists and every other query is
 * concerned. The record is copied here first so setting the account back to
 * Active can recreate it, keeping the SAME _id: orders, reservations and
 * pending indents all reference the user by id, so they stay attached.
 *
 * `strict: false` on purpose — this stores whatever the User document held at
 * suspension time, including fields added to the User schema later.
